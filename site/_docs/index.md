This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Scaland. We’ll cover topics such
as installing the library in your application, working with the different
modules, and get your applications up and running.


## So what is Scaland, exactly?

Scaland is a set of libraries that are intended to perform a set of tools
designed to ease Scala coding, specially when handling IO applications.
It provides tools to design Command Line applications, access files,
work with version control systems and more. It aims to be a helper in order
to work with Scala, usually providing DSL (Builders and implicit conversions)
APIs.


## Helpful Hints

Throughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of
information that can make using Scaland easier, more interesting, and less
hazardous. Here’s what to look out for.
